    <h2>YuPlay <em>a youtube playlist manager, and viewer!</em></h2>

    <h2>NetpbmResize <em>a PHP image resizing library</em></h2>
    <p><a href="http://netpbmresize.sf.net">A very old code</a>.  I should say obsolete, but I don't want to hurt my feelings. I have a master plan. Someday it shall be updated!<p>
