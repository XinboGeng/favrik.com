    <h1>Projects of all kinds...not</h1>

    <div class="project">
        <h2>Freelance Jobs <em>only for location independent developers</em></h2>
        <p>
        A quick project motivated by the need to only see relevant stuff. It's a very simple feed aggregator with some javascript hopefully making it more practical. View it <a href="/projects/jobs/">here</a>.
        </p>
    </div>
        
    <div class="project">
        <h2>YuPlay <em>a youtube playlist manager, and viewer!</em></h2>
        <p>
        Premise: creating playlists at Youtube sucks!  That is the main motivation for creating YuPlay, which you can preview <a href="/projects/yuplay/">here</a>, but is still a work in progress.

    <div class="project">
        <h2>NetpbmResize <em>a PHP image resizing library</em></h2>
        <p><a href="http://netpbmresize.sf.net">A very old code</a>.  I should say obsolete, but I don't want to hurt my feelings. I have a master plan. Someday it shall be updated!<p>
