 <h2>Currently <em>as of September 13, 2009</em></h2>
            <p>
            I have left my job at <a href="http://nearsoft.com">Nearsoft</a> where I was working in a very interesting startup. It was a great experience working there. I really enjoy meeting people
            that are (a lot) smarter than me, so I can learn from them. I'm thankful I did ^_^. 
            </p>

            <p>
            I will be sustaining myself via freelancing.  It's time to become a founder for an original startup. It's time to become a good developer
            </p>
