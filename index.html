            <p>
            For the past 8 months, I have been working in a startup involved with <a href="http://xmpp.org" title="Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol">XMPP</a> technologies,
            and (almost) real-time web applications.
            It has been a great ride, and is still going on.  In that period of time, I've learned a lot by just attempting 
            to do things never tried before, mostly because I didn't need to solve that kind of problems, or was being lazy. 
            </p>
             <p>Before that, I was (mostly) a PHP developer on the road to self-destruction. Turns out, knowing only PHP (or only one language for that matter)
             doesn't make you a good developer. In fact, not even an average one. I do love PHP, but it's really <a href="http://phplens.com/phpeverywhere/?q=node/view/227">just fluff</a>.
             There are far more interesting problems, which can't never be solved with just one tool, waiting for whoever comes first.  (And, sadly, there are also urgent problems of great
             scale which the majority of people prefer to ignore, or bury.)
             </p>

             <p>I could have shorten this catharsis-like post by just echoing a rarely heard quote: &#8220;Do not fall into the error of the artisan who boasts 
             of twenty years experience in his craft while in fact he has only one year of experience - twenty times.&#8221; But I didn't.
             </p>
             <p>
             Awesomely, is never too late to correct your path. 
             </p>

                I began to write again, mostly, because of Jekyll (I'm such a geek hehehe). </dd>
